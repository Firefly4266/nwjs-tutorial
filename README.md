# Welcome to NW.js! :smiley:

_This tutorial is part of a follow-along lecture originally presented by Rick Patci. Feel free to use this guide to walk through the steps at your leisure._

## Your _node_ Environment:
- Please ensure you are using a version of node compatible with the latest NW.js build (at the time of this initial documentation, node-v6.1.0).  
- If you have nvm, nodenv, etc. you may also add that particular node version.
- After node install (or upgrade): `npm i -g nw`
