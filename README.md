# Welcome to NW.js!

_This tutorial is part of a follow-along lecture originally presented by Rick Patci. Feel free to use this guide to walk through the steps at your leisure._

## Your _node_ Environment :smiley:
- Please ensure you are using the version of node recommended by nwjs (at the time of this initial documentation, node-v6.1.0).  
- If you have nvm, nodenc, etc - feel free to install a new version of node.
- After node install (or upgrade) completes (if necessary) - `npm i -g nw`
